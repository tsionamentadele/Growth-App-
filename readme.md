# SaaS Company Landing Page

This is a landing page tutorial follow up on one of my favourite tutor traversy media, i have learned a lot while making this.

This project is from the [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.
